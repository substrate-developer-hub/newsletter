# New learning material 📚| Polkadot Hackathon Announced 🏗️| Sub0 videos published 📺

The Substrate and Polkadot builder community wraps up 2022 with the [2022 round-up](https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-2022-roundup/) published last month highlighting the key moments since parachains launched just over a year ago. Building on the foundations laid down from the work this community has accomplished over the past year, 2023 will no doubt see a prosperous wave of innovation in creating value for users of the decentralized web and empowering builders. As the Zulu term “Ubuntu” roughly translates to: I am because we are.

This edition kicks off the new year with more comprehensive updates for the various builders in the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem. If you’re looking to learn about existing parachain builder platforms, keep reading onto the following sections. If you’re looking for core development updates to Substrate and Polkadot, including tooling developed by Parity Technologies, skip to theTechnical Updates section.

**📆 Upcoming events**

The [Polkadot Global Series Europe Edition](https://www.polkadotglobalseries.com/), a virtual three-week program of workshops and hackathon prizes kicks off January 25th and ends on February 17th. Be sure to register [here](https://angelhack.typeform.com/polkadotEU) to participate.

## **☕️ Technical updates**

New features added to FRAME, weight constants are now `u64`, a new RPC server was merged and the try-runtime CLI has been updated to provide more flexibility. 

**FRAME**

A new trait called `StreamIter `(see [Rust docs](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/frame_support/storage/trait.StorageStreamIter.html)) is added to the FRAME storage API, (currently only implemented for `StorageValue)` which ensures constant memory usage over the iterator’s lifetime when decoding a storage value. This can be used for decoding large data, such as events in an off-chain worker ([#12721](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12721)).

A whole new family of ensure operations have been added to [Substrate’s primitive traits](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_arithmetic/traits/index.html) for doing safe arithmetic in a node’s runtime ([#12967](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12967)). This reduces the code boilerplate, improving readability and returns the correct `ArithmeticError` type instead of an `Option.`

Pallet calls now have explicit ordering by default ([#12891](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12891)) and a warning is emitted if calls do not have this attribute declared ([#12894](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12894)). Ordering calls is important as governance voting happens on a pallet, call pair and having explicit indices will make it harder to accidentally change them.

Weight constants have changed type `Weight` to `u64` ([#12868](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12868)) making them more sensible for keeping time.

In `pallet-assets`, builders can now simply call `asset_exists` to check if an asset exists ([#12782](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12782)). 

**General**

The types of try-runtime checks with `on-runtime-upgrade `are now selectable, accepting `all, none, pre-and-post` and `try-state` which enables more flexible and faster testing, instead of always needing to run all checks which typically can be very time consuming ([#13045](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13045)).

A new RPC server was added which supports both WS an HTTPS on the same socket ([#12663](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12663)). 

## **👀 Releases**

Go to [Polkadiff](https://polkadiff.parity.io/) for a full list of merged PRs into Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus since the last Polkadot release and be sure to read the [Polkadot Release Analysis of v0.9.36](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-release-analysis-v0-9-36/1529) on the Polkadot forum. In this section, we go over updates from various core tools developed by Parity for the ecosystem. 

### **Sidecar ([v14.2.2](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar/releases/tag/v14.2.2)) 🚗**

_Sidecar is a REST service that makes it easy to interact with blockchain nodes built using Substrate's FRAME framework._

Bug fixes including using the local version of wasm-pack, avoiding the use of the transaction payment RPC in favor of the runtime API, sets RPC to call for `queryInfo` in `transaction/fee-estimate.`

### **Tx-wrapper ([v4.1.0](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core/releases/tag/v4.1.0)) 🍬**

_Tx-wrapper provides tools for FRAME chain builders to publish chain specific offline transaction generation libraries._

Updates include updating the new transaction names (`createPure` and `killPure`) from Polkadot releases > 9.30.

### **Zombienet ([v1.3.23](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/tag/v1.3.23)) 🧟**

_Zombienet is a CLI tool to easily spawn ephemeral parachain networks and perform tests against them._

Updates include improved logs, error decorations and CLI user experience.
